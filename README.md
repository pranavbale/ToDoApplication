1. Adding a Task:
In the first part of the application, users can add tasks to the to-do list. When a user wants to add a new task, they can input the task details such as the task name and the user can submit the task to be added to the list.

2. Task List Management:
The second part of the application is focused on displaying the list of tasks that the user has added. The task list will typically show the task name

When a user completes a task, they can click on the task itself, and the task will be marked as complete. After marking the task as complete, remove form the task list

Overall, the todo application provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to manage their tasks efficiently. Users can add, view, complete, and remove tasks as needed, ensuring better task organization and productivity.
